Huffman Coding is a famous Greedy Algorithm. It is used for the lossless compression of data. It uses variable length encoding. It assigns variable length code to all the characters. The code length of a character depends on how frequently it occurs in the given text.

Huffman coding tree or Huffman tree is a full binary tree in which each leaf of the tree corresponds to a letter in the given alphabet.

The following code is written down to build a Huffman Tree from a frequency table of a given dataset. It will also check the compression ratio of the original file to the Huffman tree and print the result.

We have used Binary tree and arrays to implement the following Code.
